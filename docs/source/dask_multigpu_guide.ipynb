    "\n",
    "- **Scale beyond single GPU memory**: Process datasets larger than what fits on a single GPU\n",
    "- **Accelerate training**: Distribute computation across multiple GPUs for faster model training\n",
    "- **Handle production workloads**: Deploy models that serve high-throughput prediction requests\n",

    "## Performance Considerations and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Multi-GPU\n",
    "\n",
    "Use distributed computing with Dask when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset exceeds single GPU memory**: Your data doesn't fit on a single GPU\n",
    "- **Training time is critical**: Multiple GPUs can accelerate model training\n",
    "- **Scaling to production**: You need to handle high-throughput inference workloads\n",
    "\n",
    "Single-GPU implementations are often sufficient and simpler for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Small to medium datasets**: Data that comfortably fits in single GPU memory (typically < 80% of GPU RAM)\n",
    "- **Rapid prototyping**: Simpler setup and debugging\n",
    "- **Latency-sensitive inference**: Single-GPU inference has lower overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Partitioning Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The `n_parts` parameter controls how data is distributed across workers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Rule of thumb: 2-4 partitions per worker\n",
    "n_parts = n_workers * 2  # Good starting point\n",
    "\n",
    "# More partitions: Better load balancing, more overhead\n",
    "# Fewer partitions: Lower overhead, potential load imbalance\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "For multi-node clusters, high-performance networking options are available:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NVLink**: For multi-GPU communication on the same node\n",
    "- **InfiniBand**: For fast inter-node communication\n",
    "- **UCX protocol**: Unified communication framework for optimal performance\n",
    "\n",
    "For detailed configuration examples and setup instructions, see the [RAPIDS dask-cuda documentation](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/dask-cuda/stable/examples/ucx/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Management\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RMM pool size**: Pre-allocate GPU memory to reduce allocation overhead\n",
    "- **Worker memory limit**: Set limits to prevent out-of-memory errors\n",
    "- **Partition size**: Keep partitions small enough to fit comfortably in GPU memory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Profiling\n",
    "\n",
    "Monitor your distributed computation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dask Dashboard**: Access at `client.dashboard_link` to visualize task execution\n",
    "2. **NVIDIA tools**: Use `nvidia-smi` to monitor GPU utilization\n",
    "3. **RAPIDS Memory Manager**: Enable RMM logging for memory profiling\n",

    "### Input Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "cuML's Dask estimators accept multiple input formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dask Array**: Use `dask.array` with CuPy backend for array operations\n",
