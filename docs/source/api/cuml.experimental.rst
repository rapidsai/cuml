cuml.experimental
=================

.. warning:: The ``cuml.experimental`` module contains features that are still
   under development. It is not recommended to depend on features in this
   module as they may change in future releases.

.. note:: Due to the nature of this module, it is not imported by default by
   the root ``cuml`` package. Each ``experimental`` submodule must be imported
   separately.
