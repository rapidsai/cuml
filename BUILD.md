# cuML Build From Source Guide

## Setting Up Your Build Environment

To install cuML from source, ensure the following dependencies are met:

> **Note:** The easiest way to setup a fully functional build environment is to use the conda environment files located in `conda/environments/all_*.yaml`. These files contain all the dependencies listed below except for clang-format (only needed for development/contributing) and UCX (only needed for optional multi-node operations). To create a development environment, see the [recommended conda setup](#recommended-conda-setup) at the end of this section.

**Hardware Needed to Run cuML:**
To run cuML code, you will need an NVIDIA GPU with the following minimum compute capability depending on your CUDA version:
- **CUDA 12.x**: compute capability 7.0 or higher (Volta™ architecture or newer)
- **CUDA 13.x**: compute capability 7.5 or higher (Turing™ architecture or newer)

Note that while a GPU is not required to build or develop cuML itself, it is necessary to execute and test GPU-accelerated functionality.

**Software Dependencies:**
1. CUDA Toolkit (>= 12.0) - must include development libraries (cudart, cublas, cusparse, cusolver, curand, cufft)
2. gcc (>= 13.0)
3. cmake (>= 3.30.4)
4. ninja - build system used by default
5. Python (>= 3.10 and <= 3.13)
6. Cython (>= 3.0.0)

**RAPIDS Ecosystem Libraries:**

These RAPIDS libraries must match the cuML version (e.g., all version 25.10 if building cuML 25.10):

*C++ Libraries:*
- [librmm](https://github.com/rapidsai/rmm) - RAPIDS Memory Manager (C++ library)
- [libraft](https://github.com/rapidsai/raft) - RAPIDS CUDA accelerated algorithms (C++ library)
- [libcuvs](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuvs) - CUDA Vector Search library
- [libcumlprims](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml) - cuML primitives

*Python Packages:*
- [rmm](https://github.com/rapidsai/rmm) - RAPIDS Memory Manager (Python package)
- [pylibraft](https://github.com/rapidsai/raft) - RAPIDS CUDA accelerated algorithms (Python package)
- [cuDF](https://github.com/rapidsai/cudf) - GPU DataFrame library (Python package)

**Python Build Dependencies:**
- scikit-build-core
- rapids-build-backend

**Python Runtime Dependencies:**

For detailed version requirements of runtime dependencies (numpy, scikit-learn, scipy, joblib, numba, cupy, treelite, etc.), please see [docs/source/supported_versions.rst](docs/source/supported_versions.rst).

**Other External Libraries:**
- treelite
- rapids-logger

**Multi-GPU Support:**

cuML has limited support for multi-GPU and multi-node operations. The following dependencies enable these features:

- **NCCL** (>= 2.19) - required for multi-GPU communication; provided automatically as a transitive dependency through libcuvs (listed above)
- **UCX** (>= 1.7) - optional; only required for multi-node operations (not needed for multi-GPU on a single node); must be explicitly enabled during build with `WITH_UCX=ON` (see [Using Infiniband for MNMG](wiki/mnmg/Using_Infiniband_for_MNMG.md))

**For development only:**
- clang-format (= 20.1.4) - enforces uniform C++ coding style; required for pre-commit hooks and CI checks. The packages `clang=20` and `clang-tools=20` from the conda-forge channel should be sufficient, if you are using conda. If not using conda, install the right version using your OS package manager.

### Recommended Conda Setup

It is recommended to use conda for environment/package management. If doing so, development environment .yaml files are located in `conda/environments/all_*.yaml`. These files contain most of the dependencies mentioned above. To create a development environment named `cuml_dev`, you can use the following commands (adjust the YAML filename to match your CUDA version and architecture):

```bash
conda create -n cuml_dev python=3.13
conda env update -n cuml_dev --file=conda/environments/all_cuda-130_arch-x86_64.yaml
conda activate cuml_dev
```

## Installing from Source

### Recommended Process

As a convenience, a `build.sh` script is provided to simplify the build process. The libraries will be installed to `$INSTALL_PREFIX` if set (e.g., `export INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/path`), otherwise to `$CONDA_PREFIX`.
```bash
$ ./build.sh                           # build the cuML libraries, tests, and python package, then
                                       # install them to $INSTALL_PREFIX if set, otherwise $CONDA_PREFIX
```
For workflows that involve frequent switching among branches or between debug and release builds, it is recommended that you install [ccache](https://ccache.dev/) and make use of it by passing the `--ccache` flag to `build.sh`.

To build individual components, specify them as arguments to `build.sh`:
```bash
$ ./build.sh libcuml                   # build and install the cuML C++ and C-wrapper libraries
$ ./build.sh cuml                      # build and install the cuML Python package
$ ./build.sh prims                     # build the ml-prims tests
$ ./build.sh bench                     # build the cuML C++ benchmark
$ ./build.sh prims-bench               # build the ml-prims C++ benchmark
```

Other `build.sh` options:
```bash
$ ./build.sh clean                     # remove any prior build artifacts and configuration (start over)
$ ./build.sh libcuml -v                # build and install libcuml with verbose output
$ ./build.sh libcuml -g                # build and install libcuml for debug
$ PARALLEL_LEVEL=8 ./build.sh libcuml  # build and install libcuml limiting parallel build jobs to 8 (ninja -j8)
$ ./build.sh libcuml -n                # build libcuml but do not install
$ ./build.sh prims --allgpuarch        # build the ML prims tests for all supported GPU architectures
$ ./build.sh cuml --singlegpu          # build the cuML Python package without MNMG algorithms
$ ./build.sh --ccache                  # use ccache to cache compilations, speeding up subsequent builds
```

By default, Ninja is used as the cmake generator. To override this and use, e.g., `make`, define the `CMAKE_GENERATOR` environment variable accordingly:
```bash
CMAKE_GENERATOR='Unix Makefiles' ./build.sh
```

To run the C++ unit tests (optional), from the repo root:

```bash
$ cd cpp/build
$ ./test/ml # single-GPU algorithm tests
$ ./test/ml_mg # multi-GPU algorithm tests, if --singlegpu was not used
$ ./test/prims # ML Primitive function tests
```

If you want a list of the available C++ tests:
```bash
$ ./test/ml --gtest_list_tests # single-GPU algorithm tests
$ ./test/ml_mg --gtest_list_tests # multi-GPU algorithm tests
$ ./test/prims --gtest_list_tests # ML Primitive function tests
```

To run all Python tests, including multi-GPU algorithms, from the repo root:
```bash
$ cd python
$ pytest -v
```

To run only single-GPU algorithm tests:

```bash
$ pytest --ignore=cuml/tests/dask --ignore=cuml/tests/test_nccl.py
```

If you want a list of the available Python tests:
```bash
$ pytest cuml/tests --collect-only
```

**Note:** Some tests require `xgboost`. If running tests in conda devcontainers, you must install the `xgboost` conda package manually. See `dependencies.yaml` for version information.

### Manual Process

Once dependencies are present, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml.git
```

2. Build and install `libcuml++` (C++/CUDA library containing the cuML algorithms), starting from the repository root folder:
```bash
$ cd cpp
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
```

**Note:** If CUDA is not in your PATH, you may need to set `CUDA_BIN_PATH` before running cmake:
```bash
$ export CUDA_BIN_PATH=$CUDA_HOME  # Default: /usr/local/cuda
```

If using a conda environment (recommended), configure cmake for `libcuml++`:

```bash
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$CONDA_PREFIX
```

**Note:** You may see the following warning depending on your cmake version and `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`. This warning can be safely ignored:
```
Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target ml_test because files
in some directories may conflict with libraries in implicit directories:
```
To silence it, add `-DCMAKE_IGNORE_PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib` to your `cmake` command.

To reduce compile times, you can specify GPU compute capabilities to compile for. For example, for Volta GPUs:

```bash
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$CONDA_PREFIX -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES="70"
```

Or for multiple architectures (e.g., Ampere and Hopper):

```bash
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$CONDA_PREFIX -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES="80;86;90"
```

You may also wish to make use of `ccache` to reduce build times when switching among branches or between debug and release builds:

```bash
$ cmake .. -DUSE_CCACHE=ON
```

There are many options to configure the build process, see the [customizing build section](#custom-build-options).

3. Build `libcuml++` and `libcuml`:

```bash
$ make -j
$ make install
```

To run tests (optional):
```bash
$ ./test/ml # single-GPU algorithm tests
$ ./test/ml_mg # multi-GPU algorithm tests
$ ./test/prims # ML Primitive function tests
```

If you want a list of the available tests:
```bash
$ ./test/ml --gtest_list_tests # single-GPU algorithm tests
$ ./test/ml_mg --gtest_list_tests # multi-GPU algorithm tests
$ ./test/prims --gtest_list_tests # ML Primitive function tests
```

To run cuML C++ benchmarks (optional):
```bash
$ ./bench/sg_benchmark  # single-GPU benchmarks
```
Use the `--help` option for more information.

To run ml-prims C++ benchmarks (optional):
```bash
$ ./bench/prims_benchmark  # ml-prims benchmarks
```
Use the `--help` option for more information.

To build doxygen docs for all C/C++ source files:
```bash
$ make doc
```

4. Build and install the `cuml` python package:

From the repository root:
```bash
$ python -m pip install --no-build-isolation --no-deps --config-settings rapidsai.disable-cuda=true python/cuml
```

To run Python tests (optional):

```bash
$ cd python
$ pytest -v
```

To run only single-GPU algorithm tests:

```bash
$ pytest --ignore=cuml/tests/dask --ignore=cuml/tests/test_nccl.py
```

If you want a list of the available tests:
```bash
$ pytest cuml/tests --collect-only
```

### Custom Build Options
