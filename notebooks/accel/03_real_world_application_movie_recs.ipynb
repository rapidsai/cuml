    "# Real-world Application: Movie Recommendation System\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll build a simple content-based movie recommendation system using `cuml.neighbors.NearestNeighbors`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to find movies that are similar to a given movie based on how users have rated them. We will use the popular [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) for this task. The core idea is to treat each movie as a vector in a \"user-rating space\" and find the nearest neighbors for a given movie in that space."

    "## Conclusion and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we successfully built a functional, GPU-accelerated movie recommendation system from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "By transforming the raw user ratings into a sparse movie-user matrix, we were able to represent each movie as a vector. Using `cuml.neighbors.NearestNeighbors` with cosine similarity, we could then efficiently find the \"closest\" movies to a given input, providing relevant and logical recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how a powerful primitive like k-Nearest Neighbors can be applied to solve a common, real-world problem in data science. From here, this system could be improved by incorporating movie genres or exploring more advanced recommendation algorithms like Matrix Factorization."
