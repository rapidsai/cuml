# cuML Wiki Documentation

This wiki is provided as an extension to cuML's public documentation, geared toward developers on the project.

If you are interested in contributing to cuML, read through our [contributing guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md). You are
also encouraged to read through our Python [developer guide](python/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) and C++ 
[developer guide](cpp/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) to gain an understanding for how we design our algorithms.

We have criteria for defining our [definition of done](DEFINITION_OF_DONE_CRITERIA.md) to allow us to provide high performance, maintainable and overall high quality implementations, while giving as much transparency as possible about the status of our algorithms with our users.
