**NOTE:** For the latest stable [README.md](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml/blob/master/README.md) ensure you are on the `master` branch.

cuML is a suite of libraries that implement machine learning algorithms and mathematical primitives functions that share compatible APIs with other [RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai/) projects.

cuML enables data scientists, researchers, and software engineers to run traditional tabular ML tasks on GPUs without going into the details of CUDA programming.

As an example, the following Python snippet loads input and computes DBSCAN clusters, all on GPU:
```python
import cudf
from cuml import DBSCAN

# Create and populate a GPU DataFrame
gdf_float = cudf.DataFrame()
gdf_float['0'] = [1.0, 2.0, 5.0]
gdf_float['1'] = [4.0, 2.0, 1.0]
gdf_float['2'] = [4.0, 2.0, 1.0]

# Setup and fit clusters
dbscan_float = DBSCAN(eps=1.0, min_samples=1)
dbscan_float.fit(gdf_float)

print(dbscan_float.labels_)
```

Output:
```
0    0
1    1
2    2
dtype: int32
```

More ML algorithms in cuML and more ML primitives in ml-prims are being worked on, among them: t-sne, random forests, spectral embedding, spectral clustering, random projections, support vector machine and others. Goals for future versions include more multi-gpu versions of the algorithms and primitives.

## Installation

1. Install NVIDIA drivers with CUDA 9.2 or 10.0
2. Ensure `libomp` and `libopenblas` are installed, for example via apt:
```bash
sudo apt install libopenblas-base libomp-dev
```

#### Conda
cuML can be installed using the `rapidsai` conda channel:

CUDA 9.2
```bash

conda install -c nvidia -c rapidsai -c conda-forge -c defaults cuml cudatoolkit=9.2
```

CUDA 10.0
```bash
conda install -c nvidia -c rapidsai -c conda-forge -c defaults cuml cudatoolkit=10.0
```

## <div align="left"><img src="img/rapids_logo.png" width="265px"/></div> Open GPU Data Science

The RAPIDS suite of open source software libraries aim to enable execution of end-to-end data science and analytics pipelines entirely on GPUs. It relies on NVIDIA® CUDA® primitives for low-level compute optimization, but exposing that GPU parallelism and high-bandwidth memory speed through user-friendly Python interfaces.
