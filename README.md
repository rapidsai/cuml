cuML is a suite of libraries that implement machine learning algorithms and mathematical primitives functions that share compatible APIs with other [RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai/) projects.

cuML enables data scientists, researchers, and software engineers to run
traditional tabular ML tasks on GPUs without going into the details of CUDA
programming. In most cases, cuML's Python API matches the API from
[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org).

For large datasets, these GPU-based implementations can complete 10-50x faster
than their CPU equivalents. For details on performance, see the [cuML Benchmarks
Notebook](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml/tree/branch-25.12/notebooks/tools).

As an example, the following Python snippet loads input and computes DBSCAN clusters, all on GPU, using cuDF:
```python
import cudf
from cuml.cluster import DBSCAN

# Create and populate a GPU DataFrame
gdf_float = cudf.DataFrame()
gdf_float['0'] = [1.0, 2.0, 5.0]
gdf_float['1'] = [4.0, 2.0, 1.0]
gdf_float['2'] = [4.0, 2.0, 1.0]

# Setup and fit clusters
dbscan_float = DBSCAN(eps=1.0, min_samples=1)
dbscan_float.fit(gdf_float)

print(dbscan_float.labels_)
```

Output:
```
0    0
1    1
2    2
dtype: int32
```

cuML also features multi-GPU and multi-node-multi-GPU operation, using [Dask](https://www.dask.org), for a
growing list of algorithms. The following Python snippet reads input from a CSV file and performs
a NearestNeighbors query across a cluster of Dask workers, using multiple GPUs on a single node:


Initialize a `LocalCUDACluster` configured with [UCXX](https://github.com/rapidsai/ucxx) for fast transport of CUDA arrays
```python
# Initialize UCX for high-speed transport of CUDA arrays
from dask_cuda import LocalCUDACluster

# Create a Dask single-node CUDA cluster w/ one worker per device
cluster = LocalCUDACluster(protocol="ucx",
                           enable_tcp_over_ucx=True,
                           enable_nvlink=True,
                           enable_infiniband=False)
```

Load data and perform `k-Nearest Neighbors` search. `cuml.dask` estimators also support `Dask.Array` as input:
```python

from dask.distributed import Client
client = Client(cluster)

# Read CSV file in parallel across workers
import dask_cudf
df = dask_cudf.read_csv("/path/to/csv")

# Fit a NearestNeighbors model and query it
from cuml.dask.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
nn = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors = 10, client=client)
nn.fit(df)
neighbors = nn.kneighbors(df)
```

The RAPIDS suite of open source software libraries aim to enable execution of end-to-end data science and analytics pipelines entirely on GPUs. It relies on NVIDIA® CUDA® primitives for low-level compute optimization, but exposing that GPU parallelism and high-bandwidth memory speed through user-friendly Python interfaces.
