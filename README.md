**NOTE:** For the latest stable [README.md](https://github.com/rapidsai/cuml/blob/master/README.md) ensure you are on the `master` branch.

cuML is a suite of libraries that implement machine learning algorithms and mathematical primitives functions that share compatible APIs with other [RAPIDS](https://rapids.ai/) projects.

cuML enables data scientists, researchers, and software engineers to run traditional tabular ML tasks on GPUs without going into the details of CUDA programming.

As an example, the following Python snippet loads input and computes DBSCAN clusters, all on GPU:
```python
import cudf
from cuml import DBSCAN

# Create and populate a GPU DataFrame
gdf_float = cudf.DataFrame()
gdf_float['0'] = [1.0, 2.0, 5.0]
gdf_float['1'] = [4.0, 2.0, 1.0]
gdf_float['2'] = [4.0, 2.0, 1.0]

# Setup and fit clusters
dbscan_float = DBSCAN(eps=1.0, min_samples=1)
dbscan_float.fit(gdf_float)

print(dbsca_float.labels_)
```

Output:
```
0    0
1    1
2    2
dtype: int32
```

### Supported Algorithms:

- Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (tSVD) - Single GPU
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) - Single GPU
- Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) - Single GPU
- K-Means Clustering - Multi-GPU
- K-Nearest Neighbors - Multi-GPU (Requires [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) installation to use)
- Linear Regression (Ordinary Least Squares) - Single GPU
- Ridge Regression - Single GPU
- Kalman Filter - Single GPU

Algorithms in progress:

- More Kalman Filter versions
- Lasso
- Elastic-Net
- Logistic Regression
- UMAP

More ML algorithms in cuML and more ML primitives in ml-prims are being worked on. Goals for future versions include more algorithms and multi-gpu versions of the algorithms and primitives.

## Installation

Ensure `libomp` and `libopenblas` are installed, for example via apt:
```bash
sudo apt install libopenblas-base libomp-dev
```

#### Conda
cuML can be installed using the `rapidsai` conda channel:
```bash
conda install -c nvidia -c rapidsai -c conda-forge -c pytorch -c defaults cuml
```

#### Pip
cuML can also be installed using pip. Select the package based on your version of CUDA.

*Note:* Pip has no faiss-gpu package: If installing cuML from pip and you plan to use cuml.KNN, you must install [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) manually or via conda (see below).

```bash
# cuda 9.2
pip install cuml-cuda92

# cuda 10.0
pip install cuml-cuda100
```

#### Build/Install from Source
See build [instructions](BUILD.md)

## <div align="left"><img src="img/rapids_logo.png" width="265px"/></div> Open GPU Data Science

The RAPIDS suite of open source software libraries aim to enable execution of end-to-end data science and analytics pipelines entirely on GPUs. It relies on NVIDIA® CUDA® primitives for low-level compute optimization, but exposing that GPU parallelism and high-bandwidth memory speed through user-friendly Python interfaces.
