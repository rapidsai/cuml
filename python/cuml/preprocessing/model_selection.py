    Partitions the data into four collated dataframes, mimicing sklearn's
    `train_test_split`

    Parameters
    ----------
    X: cudf.DataFrame
        Data to split, has shape (n_samples, n_features)
    y: str or cudf.Series
        Set of labels for the data, either a series of shape (n_samples) or
        the string label of a column in X containing the labels
    train_size: float or int, optional
        If float, represents the proportion [0, 1] of the data
        to be assigned to the training set. If an int, represents the number
        of instances to be assigned to the training set. Defaults to 0.8
    shuffle: bool, optional
        Whether or not to shuffle inputs before splitting
    seed: int, optional
        If shuffle is true, seeds the generator. Unseeded by default
