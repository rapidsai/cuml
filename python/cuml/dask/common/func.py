    Performs a cluster-wide reduction by first

    function takes locality into account by first
    reducing partitions local to each worker before
    reducing partitions on each host and, finally,
    reducing the partitions across the cluster into
    a single reduced partition.

    Parameters
    ----------

    futures : array-like of dask.Future futures to reduce
    func : Python reduction function accepting list
           of objects to reduce and returning a single
           reduced object.

    -------

    output : dask.Future a future containing the final reduce

def tree_reduce(objs, func=sum):

    Performs a binary tree reduce on an associative
    and commutative function in parallel across
    Dask workers. Since this supports dask.delayed
    objects, which have yet been scheduled on workers,
    it does not take locality into account. As a result,
    any local reductions should be performed before
    this function is called.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : Python function or dask.delayed function
        Function to use for reduction. The reduction function
        acceps a list of objects to reduce as an argument and
        produces a single reduced object
    objs : array-like of dask.delayed or future
           objects to reduce.
