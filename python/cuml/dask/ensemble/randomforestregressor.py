    """
    Experimental API implementing a multi-GPU Random Forest classifier
    model which fits multiple decision tree classifiers in an
    ensemble. This uses Dask to partition data over multiple GPUs
    (possibly on different nodes).

    Currently, this API makes the following assumptions:
    * The set of Dask workers used between instantiation, fit,
    and predict are all consistent
    * Training data is comes in the form of cuDF dataframes,
    distributed so that each worker has at least one partition.

    Future versions of the API will support more flexible data
    distribution and additional input types. User-facing APIs are
    expected to change in upcoming versions.

    The distributed algorithm uses an embarrassingly-parallel
    approach. For a forest with N trees being built on w workers, each
    worker simply builds N/w trees on the data it has available
    locally. In many cases, partitioning the data so that each worker
    builds trees on a subset of the total dataset works well, but
    it generally requires the data to be well-shuffled in advance.
    Alternatively, callers can replicate all of the data across
    workers so that rf.fit receives w partitions, each containing the
    same data. This would produce results approximately identical to
    single-GPU fitting.

    Please check the single-GPU implementation of Random Forest
    classifier for more information about the underlying algorithm.

        algo : string (default = 'auto')
            This is optional and required only while performing the
            predict operation on the GPU.
            'naive' - simple inference using shared memory
            'tree_reorg' - similar to naive but trees rearranged to be more
            coalescing-friendly
            'batch_tree_reorg' - similar to tree_reorg but predicting
            multiple rows per thread block
            `algo` - choose the algorithm automatically. Currently
            'batch_tree_reorg' is used for dense storage
            and 'naive' for sparse storage
        convert_dtype : bool, optional (default = True)
            When set to True, the predict method will, when necessary, convert
            the input to the data type which was used to train the model. This
            will increase memory used for the method.
        predict_model : String (default = 'GPU')
            'GPU' to predict using the GPU, 'CPU' otherwise. The GPU can only
            be used if the model was trained on float32 data and `X` is float32
            or convert_dtype is set to True.
        fil_sparse_format : boolean or string (default = auto)
            This variable is used to choose the type of forest that will be
            created in the Forest Inference Library. It is not required
            while using predict_model='CPU'.
            'auto' - choose the storage type automatically
            (currently True is chosen by auto)
            False - create a dense forest
            True - create a sparse forest, requires algo='naive'
            or algo='auto'
        delayed : bool (default = True)
            Whether to do a lazy prediction (and return Delayed objects) or an
            eagerly executed one.
