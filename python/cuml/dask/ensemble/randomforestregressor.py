class RandomForestRegressor(BaseRandomForestModel, DelayedPredictionMixin,

    """
    Experimental API implementing a multi-GPU Random Forest classifier
    model which fits multiple decision tree classifiers in an
    ensemble. This uses Dask to partition data over multiple GPUs
    (possibly on different nodes).

    Currently, this API makes the following assumptions:
     * The set of Dask workers used between instantiation, fit,
       and predict are all consistent
     * Training data comes in the form of cuDF dataframes or Dask Arrays
       distributed so that each worker has at least one partition.
     * The print_summary and print_detailed functions print the
       information of the forest on the worker.

    Future versions of the API will support more flexible data
    distribution and additional input types. User-facing APIs are
    expected to change in upcoming versions.

    The distributed algorithm uses an embarrassingly-parallel
    approach. For a forest with N trees being built on w workers, each
    worker simply builds N/w trees on the data it has available
    locally. In many cases, partitioning the data so that each worker
    builds trees on a subset of the total dataset works well, but
    it generally requires the data to be well-shuffled in advance.
    Alternatively, callers can replicate all of the data across
    workers so that rf.fit receives w partitions, each containing the
    same data. This would produce results approximately identical to
    single-GPU fitting.

    Please check the single-GPU implementation of Random Forest
    classifier for more information about the underlying algorithm.

        Specify behavior when a worker does not hold any data
        while splitting. When True, it returns the results from workers
        with data (the number of trained estimators will be less than
        n_estimators) When False, throws a RuntimeError.
        This is an experiemental parameter, and may be removed
        in the future.

        IMPORTANT: X is expected to be partitioned with at least one partition

        When persisting data, you can use
        `cuml.dask.common.utils.persist_across_workers` to simplify this:

            X_dask_cudf = dask_cudf.from_cudf(X_cudf, npartitions=n_workers)
            y_dask_cudf = dask_cudf.from_cudf(y_cudf, npartitions=n_workers)

        This is equivalent to calling `persist` with the data and workers):

        .. code-block:: python

            X_dask_cudf, y_dask_cudf = dask_client.persist([X_dask_cudf,

            Labels of training examples.
            **y must be partitioned the same way as X**
        convert_dtype : bool, optional (default = False)
            When set to True, the fit method will, when necessary, convert
            y to be the same data type as X if they differ. This will increase
            memory used for the method.

        Predicts the regressor outputs for X.


        GPU-based prediction in a multi-node, multi-GPU context works
        by sending the sub-forest from each worker to the client,
        concatenating these into one forest with the full
        `n_estimators` set of trees, and sending this combined forest to
        the workers, which will each infer on their local set of data.
        This allows inference to scale to large datasets, but the forest
        transmission incurs overheads for very large trees. For inference
        on small datasets, this overhead may dominate prediction time.
        Within the worker, this uses the cuML Forest Inference Library
        (cuml.fil) for high-throughput prediction.

        The 'CPU' fallback method works with sub-forests in-place,
        broadcasting the datasets to all workers and combining predictions
        via an averaging method at the end. This method is slower
        on a per-row basis but may be faster for problems with many trees
        and few rows.

        In the 0.15 cuML release, inference will be updated with much
        faster tree transfer.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : Dask cuDF dataframe  or CuPy backed Dask Array (n_rows, n_features)
            Distributed dense matrix (floats or doubles) of shape
            (n_samples, n_features).
        algo : string (default = 'auto')
            This is optional and required only while performing the
            predict operation on the GPU.
            'naive' - simple inference using shared memory
            'tree_reorg' - similar to naive but trees rearranged to be more
            coalescing-friendly
            'batch_tree_reorg' - similar to tree_reorg but predicting
            multiple rows per thread block
            `algo` - choose the algorithm automatically. Currently
            'batch_tree_reorg' is used for dense storage
            and 'naive' for sparse storage
        convert_dtype : bool, optional (default = True)
            When set to True, the predict method will, when necessary, convert
            the input to the data type which was used to train the model. This
            will increase memory used for the method.
        predict_model : String (default = 'GPU')
            'GPU' to predict using the GPU, 'CPU' otherwise. The GPU can only
            be used if the model was trained on float32 data and `X` is float32
            or convert_dtype is set to True.
        fil_sparse_format : boolean or string (default = auto)
            This variable is used to choose the type of forest that will be
            created in the Forest Inference Library. It is not required
            while using predict_model='CPU'.
            'auto' - choose the storage type automatically
            (currently True is chosen by auto)
            False - create a dense forest
            True - create a sparse forest, requires algo='naive'
            or algo='auto'
        delayed : bool (default = True)
            Whether to do a lazy prediction (and return Delayed objects) or an
            eagerly executed one.
