    """
    Experimental API implementing a multi-GPU Random Forest classifier
    model which fits multiple decision tree classifiers in an
    ensemble. This uses Dask to partition data over multiple GPUs
    (possibly on different nodes).

    Currently, this API makes the following assumptions:
     * The set of Dask workers used between instantiation, fit, \
        and predict are all consistent
     * Training data comes in the form of cuDF dataframes or Dask Arrays \
        distributed so that each worker has at least one partition.
     * The print_summary and print_detailed functions print the \
        information of the forest on the worker.

    Future versions of the API will support more flexible data
    distribution and additional input types.

    The distributed algorithm uses an embarrassingly-parallel
    approach. For a forest with N trees being built on w workers, each
    worker simply builds N/w trees on the data it has available
    locally. In many cases, partitioning the data so that each worker
    builds trees on a subset of the total dataset works well, but
    it generally requires the data to be well-shuffled in advance.
    Alternatively, callers can replicate all of the data across
    workers so that rf.fit receives w partitions, each containing the
    same data. This would produce results approximately identical to
    single-GPU fitting.

    Please check the single-GPU implementation of Random Forest
    classifier for more information about the underlying algorithm.

    rows_sample : float (default = 1.0)
        Ratio of dataset rows used while fitting each tree.
    max_depth : int (default = -1)
        Maximum tree depth. Unlimited (i.e, until leaves are pure), if -1.
    max_leaves : int (default = -1)
        Maximum leaf nodes per tree. Soft constraint. Unlimited, if -1.
    max_features : float (default = 'auto')

        Number of parallel streams used for forest building
    workers : optional, list of strings

        If None, all available Dask workers will be used.
    seed : int (default = None)
        Base seed for the random number generator. Unseeded by default. Does
        not currently fully guarantee the exact same results.
    ignore_empty_partitions: Boolean (default = False)
        Specify behavior when a worker does not hold any data
        while splitting. When True, it returns the results from workers
        with data (the number of trained estimators will be less than
        n_estimators) When False, throws a RuntimeError.
        This is an experiemental parameter, and may be removed
        in the future.

        Fit the input data with a Random Forest classifier

        IMPORTANT: X is expected to be partitioned with at least one partition
        on each Dask worker being used by the forest (self.workers).

        If a worker has multiple data partitions, they will be concatenated
        before fitting, which will lead to additional memory usage. To minimize
        memory consumption, ensure that each worker has exactly one partition.

        When persisting data, you can use
        `cuml.dask.common.utils.persist_across_workers` to simplify this:

        .. code-block:: python

            X_dask_cudf = dask_cudf.from_cudf(X_cudf, npartitions=n_workers)
            y_dask_cudf = dask_cudf.from_cudf(y_cudf, npartitions=n_workers)

        Predicts the labels for X.

        GPU-based prediction in a multi-node, multi-GPU context works
        by sending the sub-forest from each worker to the client,
        concatenating these into one forest with the full
        `n_estimators` set of trees, and sending this combined forest to
        the workers, which will each infer on their local set of data.
        Within the worker, this uses the cuML Forest Inference Library
        (cuml.fil) for high-throughput prediction.

        This allows inference to scale to large datasets, but the forest
        transmission incurs overheads for very large trees. For inference
        on small datasets, this overhead may dominate prediction time.

        The 'CPU' fallback method works with sub-forests in-place,
        broadcasting the datasets to all workers and combining predictions
        via a voting method at the end. This method is slower
        on a per-row basis but may be faster for problems with many trees
        and few rows.

        In the 0.15 cuML release, inference will be updated with much
        faster tree transfer. Preliminary builds with this updated approach
        will be available from rapids.ai

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : Dask cuDF dataframe  or CuPy backed Dask Array (n_rows, n_features)
            Distributed dense matrix (floats or doubles) of shape
            (n_samples, n_features).
        output_class : boolean (default = True)
            This is optional and required only while performing the
            predict operation on the GPU.
            If true, return a 1 or 0 depending on whether the raw
            prediction exceeds the threshold. If False, just return
            the raw prediction.
        algo : string (default = 'auto')
            This is optional and required only while performing the
            predict operation on the GPU.
            'naive' - simple inference using shared memory
            'tree_reorg' - similar to naive but trees rearranged to be more
            coalescing-friendly
            'batch_tree_reorg' - similar to tree_reorg but predicting
            multiple rows per thread block
            'algo' - choose the algorithm automatically. Currently
            'batch_tree_reorg' is used for dense storage
            and 'naive' for sparse storage
        threshold : float (default = 0.5)
            Threshold used for classification. Optional and required only
            while performing the predict operation on the GPU, that is for,
            predict_model='GPU'.
            It is applied if output_class == True, else it is ignored
        convert_dtype : bool, optional (default = True)
            When set to True, the predict method will, when necessary, convert
            the input to the data type which was used to train the model. This
            will increase memory used for the method.
        predict_model : String (default = 'GPU')
            'GPU' to predict using the GPU, 'CPU' otherwise. The GPU can only
            be used if the model was trained on float32 data and `X` is float32
            or convert_dtype is set to True.
        fil_sparse_format : boolean or string (default = auto)
            This variable is used to choose the type of forest that will be
            created in the Forest Inference Library. It is not required
            while using predict_model='CPU'.
            'auto' - choose the storage type automatically
            (currently True is chosen by auto)
            False - create a dense forest
            True - create a sparse forest, requires algo='naive'
            or algo='auto'
        delayed : bool (default = True)
            Whether to do a lazy prediction (and return Delayed objects) or an
            eagerly executed one.  It is not required  while using

            It is applied if output_class == True, else it is ignored
        convert_dtype : bool, optional (default = True)
            When set to True, the predict method will, when necessary, convert
            the input to the data type which was used to train the model. This
            will increase memory used for the method.
        fil_sparse_format : boolean or string (default = auto)
            This variable is used to choose the type of forest that will be
            created in the Forest Inference Library. It is not required
            while using predict_model='CPU'.
            'auto' - choose the storage type automatically
            (currently True is chosen by auto)
            False - create a dense forest
            True - create a sparse forest, requires algo='naive'
            or algo='auto'
