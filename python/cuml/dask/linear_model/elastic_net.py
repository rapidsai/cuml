class ElasticNet(BaseEstimator):

    """
    ElasticNet extends LinearRegression with combined L1 and L2 regularizations
    on the coefficients when predicting response y with a linear combination of
    the predictors in X. It can reduce the variance of the predictors, force
    some coefficients to be small, and improves the conditioning of the
    problem.

    cuML's ElasticNet an array-like object or cuDF DataFrame, uses coordinate
    descent to fit a linear model.

    Parameters
    -----------
    alpha : float (default = 1.0)
        Constant that multiplies the L1 term.
        alpha = 0 is equivalent to an ordinary least square, solved by the
        LinearRegression object.
        For numerical reasons, using alpha = 0 with the Lasso object is not
        advised.
        Given this, you should use the LinearRegression object.
    l1_ratio: float (default = 0.5)
        The ElasticNet mixing parameter, with 0 <= l1_ratio <= 1.
        For l1_ratio = 0 the penalty is an L2 penalty. For l1_ratio = 1 it is
        an L1 penalty.
        For 0 < l1_ratio < 1, the penalty is a combination of L1 and L2.
    fit_intercept : boolean (default = True)
        If True, Lasso tries to correct for the global mean of y.
        If False, the model expects that you have centered the data.
    normalize : boolean (default = False)
        If True, the predictors in X will be normalized by dividing by it's L2
        norm.
        If False, no scaling will be done.
    max_iter : int (default = 1000)
        The maximum number of iterations
    tol : float (default = 1e-3)
        The tolerance for the optimization: if the updates are smaller than
        tol, the optimization code checks the dual gap for optimality and
        continues until it is smaller than tol.
    selection : {'cyclic', 'random'} (default='cyclic')
        If set to ‘random’, a random coefficient is updated every iteration
        rather than looping over features sequentially by default.
        This (setting to ‘random’) often leads to significantly faster
        convergence especially when tol is higher than 1e-4.
    handle : cuml.Handle
        If it is None, a new one is created just for this class.
    output_type : (optional) {'input', 'cudf', 'cupy', 'numpy'} default = None
        Use it to control output type of the results and attributes.
        If None it'll inherit the output type set at the
        module level, cuml.output_type. If that has not been changed, by
        default the estimator will mirror the type of the data used for each
        fit or predict call.
        If set, the estimator will override the global option for its behavior.

    Attributes
    -----------
    coef_ : array, shape (n_features)
        The estimated coefficients for the linear regression model.
    intercept_ : array
        The independent term. If `fit_intercept` is False, will be 0.
