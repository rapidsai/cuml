def homogeneity_score(labels_true, labels_pred, handle=None):
    """
    Computes the homogeneity metric of a cluster labeling given a ground truth.

    A clustering result satisfies homogeneity if all of its clusters contain
    only data points which are members of a single class.

    This metric is independent of the absolute values of the labels:
    a permutation of the class or cluster label values wonâ€™t change the score
    value in any way.

    This metric is not symmetric: switching label_true with label_pred will
    return the completeness_score which will be different in general.

    The labels in labels_pred and labels_true are assumed to be drawn from a
    contiguous set (Ex: drawn from {2, 3, 4}, but not from {2, 4}). If your
    set of labels looks like {2, 4}, convert them to something like {0, 1}.

    Parameters
    ----------
    labels_pred : array-like (device or host) shape = (n_samples,)
        The labels predicted by the model for the test dataset.
        Acceptable formats: cuDF DataFrame, NumPy ndarray, Numba device
        ndarray, cuda array interface compliant array like CuPy
    labels_true : array-like (device or host) shape = (n_samples,)
        The ground truth labels (ints) of the test dataset.
        Acceptable formats: cuDF DataFrame, NumPy ndarray, Numba device
        ndarray, cuda array interface compliant array like CuPy
    handle : cuml.Handle
        Specifies the cuml.handle that holds internal CUDA state for
        computations in this model. Most importantly, this specifies the CUDA
        stream that will be used for the model's computations, so users can
        run different models concurrently in different streams by creating
        handles in several streams.
        If it is None, a new one is created.

    Returns
    -------
    float
      The homogeneity of the predicted labeling given the ground truth.
      Score between 0.0 and 1.0. 1.0 stands for perfectly homogeneous labeling.
