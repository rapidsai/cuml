def cython_mutual_info_score(labels_true, labels_pred, handle=None) -> float:
    """
    Computes the Mutual Information between two clusterings.

    The Mutual Information is a measure of the similarity between two labels of
    the same data.

    This metric is independent of the absolute values of the labels:
    a permutation of the class or cluster label values wonâ€™t change the score
    value in any way.

    This metric is furthermore symmetric: switching label_true with label_pred
    will return the same score value. This can be useful to measure the
    agreement of two independent label assignments strategies on the same
    dataset when the real ground truth is not known.

    The labels in labels_pred and labels_true are assumed to be drawn from a
    contiguous set (Ex: drawn from {2, 3, 4}, but not from {2, 4}). If your
    set of labels looks like {2, 4}, convert them to something like {0, 1}.

    Parameters
    ----------
    handle : cuml.Handle
    labels_pred : array-like (device or host) shape = (n_samples,)
        A clustering of the data (ints) into disjoint subsets.
        Acceptable formats: cuDF DataFrame, NumPy ndarray, Numba device
        ndarray, cuda array interface compliant array like CuPy
    labels_true : array-like (device or host) shape = (n_samples,)
        A clustering of the data (ints) into disjoint subsets.
        Acceptable formats: cuDF DataFrame, NumPy ndarray, Numba device
        ndarray, cuda array interface compliant array like CuPy
