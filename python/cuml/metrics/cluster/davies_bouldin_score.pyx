    """Compute the Davies-Bouldin score.

    The score is defined as the average similarity measure of each cluster with
    its most similar cluster, where similarity is the ratio of within-cluster
    distances to between-cluster distances. Thus, clusters which are farther
    apart and less dispersed will result in a better score.
    The minimum score is zero, with lower values indicating better clustering.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array-like, shape = (n_samples, n_features)
        The feature vectors for all samples.
    labels : array-like, shape = (n_samples,)
        The assigned cluster labels for each sample.
    metric : string
        A string representation of the distance metric to use for evaluating
        the Davies Bouldin score. Available options are "cityblock", "cosine",
        "euclidean", "l1", "l2", "manhattan", and "sqeuclidean".
    handle : cuml.Handle
        Specifies the cuml.handle that holds internal CUDA state for
        computations in this model. Most importantly, this specifies the CUDA
        stream that will be used for the model's computations, so users can
        run different models concurrently in different streams by creating
        handles in several streams.
        If it is None, a new one is created.

    Returns
    -------
    score: double
        The resulting Davies-Bouldin score.
