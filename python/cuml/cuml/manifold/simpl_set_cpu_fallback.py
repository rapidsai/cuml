    """Given a set of data X, a neighborhood size, and a measure of distance
    compute the fuzzy simplicial set (here represented as a fuzzy graph in
    the form of a sparse matrix) associated to the data. This is done by
    locally approximating geodesic distance at each point, creating a fuzzy
    simplicial set for each such point, and then combining all the local
    fuzzy simplicial sets into a global one via a fuzzy union.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X: array of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        The data to be modelled as a fuzzy simplicial set.
    n_neighbors: int
        The number of neighbors to use to approximate geodesic distance.
        Larger numbers induce more global estimates of the manifold that can
        miss finer detail, while smaller values will focus on fine manifold
        structure to the detriment of the larger picture.
    random_state: numpy RandomState or equivalent
        A state capable being used as a numpy random state.
    metric: string (default='euclidean').
        Distance metric to use. Supported distances are ['l1, 'cityblock',
        'taxicab', 'manhattan', 'euclidean', 'l2', 'sqeuclidean', 'canberra',
        'minkowski', 'chebyshev', 'linf', 'cosine', 'correlation', 'hellinger',
        'hamming', 'jaccard']
        Metrics that take arguments (such as minkowski) can have arguments
        passed via the metric_kwds dictionary.
        Note: The 'jaccard' distance metric is only supported for sparse
        inputs.
    metric_kwds: dict (optional, default=None)
        Metric argument
    knn_indices: array of shape (n_samples, n_neighbors) (optional)
        If the k-nearest neighbors of each point has already been calculated
        you can pass them in here to save computation time. This should be
        an array with the indices of the k-nearest neighbors as a row for
        each data point.
    knn_dists: array of shape (n_samples, n_neighbors) (optional)
        If the k-nearest neighbors of each point has already been calculated
        you can pass them in here to save computation time. This should be
        an array with the distances of the k-nearest neighbors as a row for
        each data point.
    set_op_mix_ratio: float (optional, default 1.0)
        Interpolate between (fuzzy) union and intersection as the set operation
        used to combine local fuzzy simplicial sets to obtain a global fuzzy
        simplicial sets. Both fuzzy set operations use the product t-norm.
        The value of this parameter should be between 0.0 and 1.0; a value of
        1.0 will use a pure fuzzy union, while 0.0 will use a pure fuzzy
        intersection.
    local_connectivity: int (optional, default 1)
        The local connectivity required -- i.e. the number of nearest
        neighbors that should be assumed to be connected at a local level.
        The higher this value the more connected the manifold becomes
        locally. In practice this should be not more than the local intrinsic
        dimension of the manifold.
    verbose: bool (optional, default False)
        Whether to report information on the current progress of the algorithm.
    Returns
    -------
    fuzzy_simplicial_set: coo_matrix
        A fuzzy simplicial set represented as a sparse matrix. The (i,
        j) entry of the matrix represents the membership strength of the
        1-simplex between the ith and jth sample points.

    initialisation method and then minimizing the fuzzy set cross entropy
    between the 1-skeletons of the high and low dimensional fuzzy simplicial
    sets.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data: array of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        The source data to be embedded by UMAP.
    graph: sparse matrix
        The 1-skeleton of the high dimensional fuzzy simplicial set as
        represented by a graph for which we require a sparse matrix for the
        (weighted) adjacency matrix.
    n_components: int
        The dimensionality of the euclidean space into which to embed the data.
    initial_alpha: float
        Initial learning rate for the SGD.
    a: float
        Parameter of differentiable approximation of right adjoint functor
    b: float

    gamma: float
        Weight to apply to negative samples.
    negative_sample_rate: int (optional, default 5)
        The number of negative samples to select per positive sample
        in the optimization process. Increasing this value will result
        in greater repulsive force being applied, greater optimization
        cost, but slightly more accuracy.
    n_epochs: int (optional, default 0)
        The number of training epochs to be used in optimizing the
        low dimensional embedding. Larger values result in more accurate
        embeddings. If 0 is specified a value will be selected based on
        the size of the input dataset (200 for large datasets, 500 for small).
    init: string
        How to initialize the low dimensional embedding. Options are:
            * 'spectral': use a spectral embedding of the fuzzy 1-skeleton
            * 'random': assign initial embedding positions at random.
            * An array-like with initial embedding positions.
    random_state: numpy RandomState or equivalent
        A state capable being used as a numpy random state.
    metric: string (default='euclidean').
        Distance metric to use. Supported distances are ['l1, 'cityblock',
        'taxicab', 'manhattan', 'euclidean', 'l2', 'sqeuclidean', 'canberra',
        'minkowski', 'chebyshev', 'linf', 'cosine', 'correlation', 'hellinger',

        passed via the metric_kwds dictionary.
        Note: The 'jaccard' distance metric is only supported for sparse
        inputs.
    metric_kwds: dict (optional, default=None)
        Metric argument
    output_metric: function
        Function returning the distance between two points in embedding space
        and the gradient of the distance wrt the first argument.
    output_metric_kwds: dict
        Key word arguments to be passed to the output_metric function.
    verbose: bool (optional, default False)
        Whether to report information on the current progress of the algorithm.
    Returns
