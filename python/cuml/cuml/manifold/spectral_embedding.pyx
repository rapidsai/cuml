    """Project the sample on the first eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian.

    The adjacency matrix is used to compute a normalized graph Laplacian
    whose spectrum (especially the eigenvectors associated to the
    smallest eigenvalues) has an interpretation in terms of minimal
    number of cuts necessary to split the graph into comparably sized
    components.

    Note : Laplacian Eigenmaps is the actual algorithm implemented here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        The input data. A k-NN graph will be constructed.
    n_components : int, default=8
        The dimension of the projection subspace.
    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
        A pseudo random number generator used for the initialization.
        Use an int to make the results deterministic across calls.
    n_neighbors : int or None, default=None
        Number of nearest neighbors for nearest_neighbors graph building.
        If None, n_neighbors will be set to max(n_samples/10, 1).
        Only used when A has shape (n_samples, n_features).
    norm_laplacian : bool, default=True
        If True, then compute symmetric normalized Laplacian.
    drop_first : bool, default=True
        Whether to drop the first eigenvector. For spectral embedding, this
        should be True as the first eigenvector should be constant vector for
        connected graph, but for spectral clustering, this should be kept as
        False to retain the first eigenvector.
    handle : cuml.Handle
        Specifies the cuml.handle that holds internal CUDA state for
        computations in this model. Most importantly, this specifies the CUDA
        stream that will be used for the model's computations, so users can
        run different models concurrently in different streams by creating
        handles in several streams.
        If it is None, a new one is created.

    Returns
    -------
    embedding : cupy.ndarray of shape (n_samples, n_components)
        The reduced samples.

    Notes
    -----
    Spectral Embedding (Laplacian Eigenmaps) is most useful when the graph
    has one connected component. If there graph has many components, the first
    few eigenvectors will simply uncover the connected components of the graph.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import cupy as cp
    >>> from cuml.manifold import spectral_embedding
    >>> X = cp.random.rand(100, 20, dtype=cp.float32)
    >>> embedding = spectral_embedding(X, n_components=2, random_state=42)

        Return results and set estimator attributes to the indicated output

    Attributes
    ----------
    embedding_ : cupy.ndarray of shape (n_samples, n_components)
        Spectral embedding of the training matrix.

    Notes
    -----
    Currently, cuML's SpectralEmbedding only supports the 'nearest_neighbors'
    affinity mode, where a k-NN graph is constructed from the input data.

    Spectral Embedding (Laplacian Eigenmaps) is most useful when the graph
    has one connected component. If there graph has many components, the first
    few eigenvectors will simply uncover the connected components of the graph.
