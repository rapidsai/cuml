# E999: invalid syntax (works for Python, not Cython)
# E225: Missing whitespace around operators (breaks cython casting syntax like <int>)
# E226: Missing whitespace around arithmetic operators (breaks cython pointer syntax like int*)
# E227: Missing whitespace around bitwise or shift operator (Can also break casting syntax)
# W503: line break before binary operator (breaks lines that start with a pointer)
# W504: line break after binary operator (breaks lines that end with a pointer)
