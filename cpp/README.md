# cuML C++

This folder contains the C++ and CUDA code of the algorithms and ML primitives of cuML. The build system uses CMake for build configuration, and an out-of-source build is recommended.

## Source Code Folders

The source code of cuML is divided mainly into `src` and `src_prims`.

- `src` contains the source code of the Machine Learning algorithms, and the main cuML C++ API. The main consumable is the shared library `libcuml`, that can be used stand alone by C++ consumers or is consumed by our Python package `cuml` to provide a Python API.
- `src_prims` contains most of the common components and computational primitives that form part of the machine learning algorithms in cuML, and can be used individually as well in the form of a header only library.

Multi-GPU communication is provided through RAFT communicator APIs; cuML does not build separate `std` or `mpi` communicator libraries. The `tests` directory contains single-GPU, multi-GPU, and primitive tests.

## Setup
### Dependencies

1. cmake (>= 3.26.4)
2. CUDA (>= 12.2)
3. gcc (>=13.0)
4. clang-format (= 20.1.8) - enforces uniform C++ coding style; required to build cuML from source. The packages `clang=20` and `clang-tools=20` from the conda-forge channel should be sufficient, if you are on conda. If not using conda, install the right version using your OS package manager.

### Building cuML:

The main artifact produced by the build system is the shared library `libcuml`. Additionally, executables to run tests for the algorithms can be built. To see detailed steps see the [BUILD](../BUILD.md) document of the repository.

Current cmake offers the following configuration options:

- Build Configuration Options:

| Flag | Possible Values | Default Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BUILD_CUML_CPP_LIBRARY | [ON, OFF]  | ON  | Enable/disable building the `libcuml` shared library. Setting this variable to `OFF` also forces `BUILD_CUML_TESTS`, `BUILD_CUML_MG_TESTS`, `BUILD_CUML_EXAMPLES`, `BUILD_PRIMS_TESTS`, and `BUILD_CUML_BENCH` to `OFF` |
| BUILD_CUML_TESTS | [ON, OFF]  | ON  |  Enable/disable building cuML single-GPU C++ test targets.  |
| BUILD_CUML_MG_TESTS | [ON, OFF]  | OFF | Enable/disable building cuML multi-GPU C++ test targets. Requires MPI and RAFT distributed dependencies. See section about additional requirements. |
| BUILD_PRIMS_TESTS | [ON, OFF]  | ON  | Enable/disable building cuML primitive C++ test targets.  |
| BUILD_CUML_EXAMPLES | [ON, OFF]  | ON  | Enable/disable building cuML C++ API usage examples.  |
| BUILD_CUML_BENCH | [ON, OFF]  | ON  | Enable/disable building of cuML C++ benchmark. |
| SINGLEGPU | [ON, OFF] | OFF | Disable cuML MNMG C++ sources and tests, and build cuVS without multi-GPU algorithms. Forces `BUILD_CUML_MG_TESTS` to `OFF`. |
| DISABLE_OPENMP | [ON, OFF]  | OFF  | Set to `ON` to disable OpenMP  |
| CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES |  List of GPU architectures, semicolon-separated | Empty  | List the GPU architectures to compile the GPU targets for. Set to "NATIVE" to auto detect GPU architecture of the system, set to "ALL" to compile for all RAPIDS supported archs: ["60" "62" "70" "72" "75" "80" "86"].  |
| USE_CCACHE | [ON, OFF]  | ON  | Cache build artifacts with ccache. |

- Debug configuration options:

| Flag | Possible Values | Default Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| KERNEL_INFO | [ON, OFF]  | OFF  | Enable/disable kernel resource usage info in nvcc. |
| LINE_INFO | [ON, OFF]  | OFF  | Enable/disable lineinfo in nvcc.  |
| NVTX | [ON, OFF]  | OFF  | Enable/disable nvtx markers in libcuml.  |

After running CMake in a `build` directory, if the `BUILD_*` options were not turned `OFF`, the following targets can be built:

```bash
$ cmake --build . -j                        # Build libcuml and enabled C++ test targets
$ cmake --build . -j --target  sg_benchmark # Build C++ cuML single-GPU benchmark
$ cmake --build . -j --target  cuml         # Build libcuml

# Test executables are generated as individual CTest targets with SG_, MG_, or PRIMS_ prefixes.
```

### MultiGPU Tests Requirements Note:

To build the MultiGPU tests (CMake option `BUILD_CUML_MG_TESTS`), the following dependencies are required:

- MPI (OpenMPI recommended)
- RAFT distributed dependencies, including NCCL and UCXX/UCX. See RAFT's build documentation for the current requirements.

### Third Party Modules

The external folder contains submodules that cuML depends on.

Current external submodules are:

1. [CUB](https://github.com/NVlabs/cub)
2. [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)
3. [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest)

## Using cuML libraries

After building cuML, you can use its functionality in other C++ applications by
linking against the generated libraries, or from Python via the `cuml` package.
The following trivial example shows
how to make external use of cuML's logger:

```cpp
// main.cpp
#include <cuml/common/logger.hpp>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  CUML_LOG_WARN("This is a warning from the cuML logger!");
  return 0;
}
```

To compile this example, we must point the compiler to where cuML was
installed. Assuming you did not provide a custom `$CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`, this
will default to the `$CONDA_PREFIX` environment variable.

```bash
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib"
$ nvcc \
       main.cpp \
       -o cuml_logger_example \
       "-L${CONDA_PREFIX}/lib" \
       "-I${CONDA_PREFIX}/include" \
       "-I${CONDA_PREFIX}/include/cuml/raft" \
       -lcuml
$ ./cuml_logger_example
[W] [13:26:43.503068] This is a warning from the cuML logger!
```
