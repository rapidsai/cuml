 * @param[in]     handle        The handle to the cuML library context that
 manages the CUDA resources.
 * @param[in]     params        Parameters for KMeans model.
 * @param[in]     X             Training instances to cluster. It must be noted
 that the data must be in row-major format and stored in device accessible
 * location.
 * @param[in]     n_samples     Number of samples in the input X.
 * @param[in]     n_features    Number of features or the dimensions of each
 * sample.
 * @param[inout]  centroids     When init is InitMethod::Array, use
 centroids as the initial cluster centers
 *                              [out] Otherwise, generated centroids from the
 kmeans algorithm is stored at the address pointed by 'centroids'.
 * @param[out]    inertia       Sum of squared distances of samples to their
 closest cluster center.
 * @param[out]    n_iter        Number of iterations run.
