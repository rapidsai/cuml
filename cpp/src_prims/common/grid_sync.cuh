 * @note In order to call `GridSync::sync` method consecutively on the same
 * object inside the same kernel, make sure you set the 'multiSync' flag that is
 * passed `GridSync::computeWorkspaceSize` as well as `GridSync` constructor.
 * Having this flag not set, but trying to call `sync` method consecutively in
 * the same kernel using that same object can lead to deadlock and thus such a
 * usage is discouraged. Example follows:
 *
 * @code{.cu}
 * __global__ void kernelMultiple(void* workspace, SyncType type, ...) {
 *   GridSync gs(workspace, type, true);
 *   ////// Part1 //////
 *   // do pre-sync work here

 *   gs.sync();
 *   // do post-sync work here
 *   // ...
 *   ////// Part2 //////
 *   // do pre-sync work here
 *   // ...
 *   gs.sync();
 *   // do post-sync work here
 *   // ...
 *   ////// Part3 //////
 *   // do pre-sync work here
 *   // ...
 *   gs.sync();
 *   // do post-sync work here
 *   // ...
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @todo Implement the lock-free synchronization approach described in this
 * paper: https://synergy.cs.vt.edu/pubs/papers/xiao-ipdps2010-gpusync.pdf
 * Probably cleaner to implement this as a separate class?
